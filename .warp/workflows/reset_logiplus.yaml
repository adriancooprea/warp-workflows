description: "Kills the LogiOptions+ client process and then gets started automatically. The LogiOptions+ process fails to 
work after the laptop goes on sleep or idle. Happens on multiple CPU architectures, operating systems, and laptop models. 
This is not something related to the hardware but a software problem."
